# GECO Information and Instructions

The Georgia Air Protection Branch has developed an online facility information system called Georgia Environmental Connections Online or GECO. GECO displays facility information, permit application status, and performance test notifications. GECO is used by facilities to generate permit fee invoices, submit emissions inventories and emissions statements, and register for events hosted by the Georgia Environmental Protection Division.

## How to create a GECO account

Go to the GECO homepage at `https://geco.gaepd.org/`, select "Register", and follow the instructions for creating an account.

Once you have registered, a confirmation email with an activation link will be sent to your email address. You must confirm your email before you will be able to sign into GECO. 

*If you do not receive a confirmation email, check your junk mail/spam/quarantine folder and ensure that you can receive emails from `GeorgiaAirProtectionBranch@dnr.ga.gov`.*

After logging into GECO, you can select "Account" in the menu to update your profile or change your email address or password.

## How to access your facility

The GECO home page will list the facilities that you have access to and the permissions associated with your account for each facility. If you do not have access to the facilities you need, select "Request access to a facility" and follow the instructions.

Once you have access to the facility you need, select it on the home page to access applications related to that facility. If you are an administrator for a facility, you can select "User Access" to add or remove other users for your facility.
